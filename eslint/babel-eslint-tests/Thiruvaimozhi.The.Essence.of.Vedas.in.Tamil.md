# Thiruvaimozhi: The Essence of Vedas in Tamil
 
Thiruvaimozhi is a collection of 1102 hymns composed by Nammazhwar, one of the 12 Alwars (saints) who sang praises of Lord Vishnu in Tamil. Thiruvaimozhi is considered as the essence of Vedas in Tamil, as it reveals the supreme truths of Vedanta in a simple and poetic language. Thiruvaimozhi is also known as Dravida Veda Sagaram (the ocean of Vedas in Dravidian language) and Sama Veda Saram (the essence of Sama Veda).

Thiruvaimozhi means "the sacred words of the Lord" or "the words that lead to the Lord". It is divided into 10 sections, each containing 100 hymns, except for the last one which has 102 hymns. Each section is called a pathu (decad) and each hymn is called a pasuram (verse). The pasurams are arranged in a specific meter and rhyme scheme, and each pathu has a common theme or mood. The themes range from the longing for the Lord, the joy of experiencing His grace, the praise of His qualities and deeds, the surrender to His will, and the desire to attain His abode.
 
Thiruvaimozhi is not only a devotional work, but also a philosophical treatise that expounds the five fundamental doctrines of Sri Vaishnavism, known as artha panchakam. These are: 1) The nature of the Supreme Lord (paratva), 2) The nature of the individual soul (jivatva), 3) The means of liberation (upaya), 4) The goal of liberation (purushartha), and 5) The obstacles to liberation (viruddha). Thiruvaimozhi also explains the concepts of prapatti (surrender), bhakti (devotion), acharya (preceptor), and prabandha (sacred text).
 
Thiruvaimozhi is revered as the most authoritative and comprehensive scripture by Sri Vaishnavas, who consider it as equal or superior to the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and other Sanskrit texts. Many commentaries have been written on Thiruvaimozhi by eminent acharyas such as Pillan, Nanjiyar, Periyavachan Pillai, Vadakku Thiruveedhi Pillai, Manavala Mamuni, and Vedanta Desika. Thiruvaimozhi is also recited daily in temples and homes by Sri Vaishnavas as a form of worship and meditation.
